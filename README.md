### Hi, I'm Daniel Sinderson.
I'm an aspiring data analyst and applied mathematician who likes to make things with code and wires. I'm interested in qualitative and quantitative research methods, and in the mathematical and statistical modeling of complex systems.

I have a B.A. in Anthropology, an A.A.S. in Electronics Engineering, and a B.S. in Mathematics, and I'm currently working through a course of advanced study that can be found [here](https://github.com/danielsinderson/DIY-Grad-School). I've recently been enjoying working with R and Julia for data analysis and mathematical modeling, and I have over 7 years of experience writing Python and C for personal projects including natural language processing and generation, small games, websites (via Reflex), digital synthesizers, and myriad one-off helper scripts.

For more information on who I am and what projects I'm working on, you can go to my website [here](https://workingtheory.reflex.run/).
