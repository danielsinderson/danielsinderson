### Hi, I'm Daniel Sinderson.
I got into programming for the poetry bots and the digital synthesizers. I stayed because of how powerful a tool it is for making, exploring, and testing things. I have just over 7 years of experience writing Python and C for personal projects including NLP, PCG, data analysis, websites, the aforementioned bots and synths, and myriad one-off helper scripts.

I'm also a math nerd with special love for the applied sides of differential equations and category theory, and an anthropology nerd with special love for ethnographic methods and institutional theory. I have a B.A. in Anthropology, an A.A.S. in Electronics Engineering, and (soon!) a B.S. in Mathematics.
