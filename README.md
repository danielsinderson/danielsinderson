### Hi, I'm Daniel Sinderson.
I got into programming for the poetry bots and the digital synthesizers. I stayed because of how powerful a tool it is for making, exploring, and testing things. I have just over 7 years of experience writing Python and C for personal projects including NLP, PCG, data analysis, websites, the aforementioned bots and synths, and myriad one-off helper scripts. I recently started to learn Julia as well and am in love (it had me at its package management system).

I'm also a math nerd with special love for the applied sides of differential equations and category theory, and an anthropology nerd with special love for ethnographic methods and institutional theory. I have a B.A. in Anthropology, an A.A.S. in Electronics Engineering, and (soon!) a B.S. in Mathematics.


Fun Fact: I know what a monad is which makes me think I should learn Haskell, but I don't really want to learn Haskell.
